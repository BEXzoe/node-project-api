Develop an API using Node and Express with the following features:

Manage a MySQL table called producto. It will have the following fields:

id: the product code, of type integer (must not be auto-incremented),

descripcion: varchar,

valor: integer.

Manage a MySQL table called movimiento. It will have:

id: auto-incremented,

id_producto: a foreign key referencing the producto table,

descripcion_movimiento: description of the movement,

movimiento: an integer value.

The API must be built using a layered architecture (e.g., routes, controllers, services, models).

Endpoints to handle CRUD operations for products. When deleting a product, it should only allow deletion if the product has no movements.

An endpoint to store a movement. It will:

Search for the product by id,

Save the descripcion_movimiento from the incoming JSON,

Save the movimiento value from the JSON.

In descripcion_movimiento, three types are expected:

A sale: if it's a sale, store the movement as a negative integer, and return the total sale value to the client.

A transfer: if it's a transfer, also store the movement as a negative integer (e.g., from one warehouse to another).

A purchase: store the movement as a positive integer.

An endpoint to display all movements of a specific product. Movements can be either negative or positive.

An endpoint to only display the balance (current stock) of a product.
